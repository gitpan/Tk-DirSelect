This is the README file for Tk::DirSelect

This widget allows the user to navigate drives 
and directories and select a directory.  On Win32 
systems, DirSelect uses the Win32API::File module 
to obtain a list of available drives, and the 
Tk::DirTree widget to browse them.  On Unix systems 
it is simply a dialog box with a DirTree in it. 

To use Tk::DirSelect, you will need Perl, probably
version 5.002 or better, Tk, and Tk modules Frame, 
Button, Radiobutton, Label, DirTree.  On Win32 systems 
you will also need the module Win32API::File. 

To build this extension, simply enter:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install
